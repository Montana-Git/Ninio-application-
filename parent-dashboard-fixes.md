# Parent Dashboard Fixes

This document outlines the fixes made to address issues in the parent dashboard.

## 1. AppSidebar Profile Issue

**Problem:** The sidebar was showing different profiles when clicked.

**Solution:**
- Updated the Sidebar component to use the AuthContext directly
- Made the Sidebar component more robust by adding fallbacks
- Standardized how the Sidebar is used across all parent dashboard pages

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/dashboard/Sidebar.tsx`
- `src/pages/dashboard/parent.tsx`
- `src/pages/dashboard/parent/children.tsx`
- `src/pages/dashboard/parent/profile.tsx`
- `src/pages/dashboard/parent/reports.tsx`

## 2. Dashboard Cards Loading Slowly

**Problem:** Dashboard cards were taking a long time to load.

**Solution:**
- Added loading states to DashboardCard, StatCard, and ActivityCard components
- Implemented parallel data fetching using Promise.all for better performance
- Added proper error handling and loading indicators

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/dashboard/DashboardCard.tsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/StatCard.tsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/ActivityCard.tsx`
- `src/pages/dashboard/parent.tsx`

## 3. Add Child Function Not Working

**Problem:** The function to add a child wasn't working due to Supabase RLS policy issues.

**Solution:**
- Created a new migration to add RLS policies for parents to add and update their children
- Improved error handling in the add/edit child functions
- Added better validation and user feedback
- Added loading indicators to show when operations are in progress

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/dashboard/parent/ChildrenManagement.tsx`
- `supabase/migrations/20240801000001_add_parent_children_policies.sql` (new file)

## How to Apply the RLS Policy Fix

The issue with adding children is due to missing Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase. Parents can view their children but don't have permission to add or update them.

### Option 1: Apply via Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the following SQL and run it:

```sql
-- Add policies for parents to manage their own children
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Parents can insert their own children" ON children;
CREATE POLICY "Parents can insert their own children"
  ON children FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = parent_id);

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Parents can update their own children" ON children;
CREATE POLICY "Parents can update their own children"
  ON children FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = parent_id);
```

### Option 2: Apply via Supabase CLI

If you have the Supabase CLI installed, you can run:

```bash
supabase db push
```

This will apply all migrations, including the new one we've created.

## Verification

After applying the migration, try adding a child again. The 403 Forbidden error should be resolved, and you should be able to add and update children as a parent user.
